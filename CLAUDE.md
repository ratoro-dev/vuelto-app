# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Rumbo is a personal-finance mobile app that works **offline** and syncs with the user's WhatsApp-bot account. Expenses are registered by voice, text ("450 feria efectivo"), a photo of the receipt, or the DGI QR code printed on a Uruguayan CFE (Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico). Everything is processed on the phone, queued, and uploaded when the connection comes back. It also covers a monthly budget, savings goals (with an emergency fund), debts, bills due, and investments. The app was previously called Vuelto (receipts only); the receipt and paper-reading code comes from it. Stack: Ionic 9 + Vue 3 (`<script setup>`) + TypeScript + Pinia + Capacitor 8, built with Vite and tested with Vitest.

All UI copy, code comments and test descriptions are in **Rioplatense Spanish** (voseo: "Apuntá al código QR", and "setiembre", not "septiembre"). Keep new code consistent with that.

## Commands

Prefer the **Ionic CLI** (`ionic`, installed globally, not a project dependency) for serving, building and Capacitor tasks:

```bash
ionic serve            # dev server at http://localhost:8100 (runs vite --host=localhost --port=8100)
ionic build            # runs npm run build: typecheck + vite build to dist/
ionic cap add android|ios
ionic cap sync         # build + copy web assets/plugins to native projects
ionic cap open android|ios
```

Tests and typechecking have no Ionic command; use npm:

```bash
npm test               # vitest run (tests/unit/**/*.spec.ts, jsdom)
npm run test:watch
npm run typecheck      # vue-tsc --noEmit
npx vitest run tests/unit/cfe.spec.ts         # single file
npx vitest run -t "resta los descuentos"      # single test by name
```

The test devices' IDs (`IPHONE_UDID`, `WATCH_UDID`, `ANDROID_SERIAL`) live in `.env.local`, which is not committed; `.env.example` lists the variables. Load them with `set -a; source .env.local; set +a`, then use `xcrun devicectl … --device "$IPHONE_UDID"` or `adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL"`. They have no `VITE_` prefix, so Vite never bundles them.

There is no linter. `tsconfig.json` is `strict` with `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters`, so an unused import or parameter fails `typecheck` and `build`. The `@/` alias maps to `src/` in both Vite and TS.

The browser has no camera. Registrar's camera screen shows a drawn receipt with three buttons instead: "Simular QR" (uses `DEMO_SCAN.qr` from the seed), "Pegar QR" (the text of a real QR) and "Ticket de ejemplo" (`DEMO_PAPER`, a paper receipt with one doubtful amount). Movimientos → sync icon → Pruebas has a "Simular sin señal" switch and "Volver a los datos de ejemplo", which resets every store.

## Architecture

**Layering.** `src/domain/` is pure TypeScript with no Ionic, Vue or Capacitor imports, and it is the only layer with tests. Put business rules there. `src/services/` wraps Capacitor plugins and always has a safe web fallback (check with `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`). Four Pinia setup stores connect the two layers for the views:
- `stores/gastos.ts`: the `Ticket[]` (every expense, whatever its source) and the per-vendor rules.
- `stores/finanzas.ts`: budget, savings goals, debts, bills and the investment portfolio.
- `stores/sync.ts`: connection state and the upload/download with the bot's server.
- `stores/carga.ts`: the cart of Registrar ("la carga"), expenses built on screen but not saved yet. It lives in memory only.

`App.vue` runs `gastos.init()` and `finanzas.init()`, then `sync.start()`.

**State and persistence.** Each store serializes its whole state to Capacitor Preferences through `stored(KEYS.x)` (`services/storage.ts`). The keys are `rumbo.gastos.v1`, `rumbo.puestos.v1` (vendor rules), `rumbo.finanzas.v1`, `rumbo.sync.v1` and `rumbo.servidor-simulado.v1`. Every mutation ends with `persist()`, which rewrites the full value. On first launch (nothing stored) `init()` loads the seed (`seedTickets()`, `seedBudget()`, `seedGoals()`…) and saves it. The seed builds dates relative to today, so the demo always shows the current month. Changing the shape of a stored type means handling data already stored under its key.

**Money rules** (`domain/totals.ts`, `domain/money.ts`). These rules are the core of the app:
- Amounts are plain `number` pesos, IVA included. Round every sum with `round2`.
- `Discount.amount` is positive and is **always subtracted** (Ley 19.210, bank, store). This is deliberate: a competitor showed the Ley 19.210 line without subtracting it.
- Credit notes (CFE types 102 and 112, `CREDIT_NOTE_TYPES`) flip sign in both `ticketTotals` and `summarize`.
- `checkAgainstQr` compares `|net|` with `cfe.total` within `QR_TOLERANCE` (0.50) to validate the line reading.
- `formatUYU` produces `$ 1.046,40` (dot for thousands, comma for decimals, U+2212 `−` for negatives). `formatPesos` is the Rumbo display format (`$ 12.450`, `− $ 450`, `+ $ 2.000`, decimals only when the amount has cents); `formatUsd` does the same with `USD`. Use `parseAmount` for user input, since it accepts both `1.046,40` and `1046.40`.
- Budget (`domain/budget.ts`) splits each ticket's discounts across its lines proportionally, and `vsPrevious` compares with the previous month up to the same day. A category is `atRisk` from 80% of its limit.
- **The budget covers day-to-day spending only.** Bills (fixed costs) are tracked separately in Facturas. `budgetStatus(..., bills)` and `monthProjection` drop incomes and any expense that `billPaymentIds` recognizes as a bill payment, so paying a bill (with the circle or by registering the expense) changes neither what is spent nor the projection.
- `monthProjection` is what is spent so far plus what the previous month spent after today's day, rounded to whole pesos.
- Fixed costs are still visible:
  - Paying a bill adds an expense with `Ticket.billId`, and `useFixedCostIds` (`composables/fixedCosts.ts`) marks these as "Gasto fijo · Factura" in Movimientos and Hoy.
  - Inicio reads "Te quedan para gastos del día a día". Its "Gastos fijos de octubre" card shows what has been paid of the month's total, with a bar and the next bill.
  - Presupuesto opens with "Plan de octubre": fixed costs plus the day-to-day budget, a split bar, and a link to Facturas. Below come the day-to-day card, the projection and "Día a día por categoría".
- Expenses paid in dollars keep their lines in pesos, converted at `USD_RATE` (`domain/money.ts`, 40 until the server provides the day's rate), so the budget keeps working. The original amount is in `Ticket.usd` (`{ amount, rate }`), which is what lists and `GastoPage` show, and it travels to the server as `RemoteExpense.usd`.

**Dates** are local `IsoDate` strings (`'2026-09-30'`), never `Date` objects in the model. Month keys are `'YYYY-MM'` (`monthKey`, `shiftMonth`). UI labels come from `relativeDay` ("Hoy", "Ayer"), `dueLabel` ("Vie 9 · en 3 días") and `timeOf`.

**Registering an expense** (`views/RegistrarPage.vue`, "Nuevos gastos"). It works like a cart: expenses go into "la carga" (`stores/carga.ts`, the pure helpers are in `domain/carga.ts`) and nothing is saved until "Guardar todo", which calls `gastos.addAll` and returns to Inicio with a toast. Every cart entry is a `Draft` (`{ id, title, ticket: NewTicket }`).
- The keypad screen has the cart list, "Sumar" chips (`frequentExpenses`: the single-line expenses repeated most often, then the most recent), and the expense being typed. That expense has an amount from the numeric keypad (`pressKey`, `keypadDisplay`, `keypadAmount`), a `$`/`USD` toggle, a description, a 3×2 category grid of day-to-day categories (`KEYPAD_CATEGORIES`: Supermercado, Delivery, Transporte, Salidas, Salud, Otros; Delivery and Salidas are subcategories of "Delivery y salidas", and the last cell turns into Servicios or Hogar when the description says so), a payment button that cycles, and a date. The typed expense counts in "Guardar todo" and moves into the cart with "+ Agregar otro".
- A phrase typed in the description with no amount on the keypad ("450 feria efectivo y 52 de ómnibus") is parsed like dictation: `parseQuickEntries` → `phraseDrafts`.
- The keypad screen shows the cart as one row ("En la carga · sin guardar", the last one added and the total). Tapping it opens "Tu carga" (`components/registrar/CargaSheet.vue`), which lists every draft plus the expense being typed ("el que estabas cargando"), each with its origin (`draftOrigin`: Voz, Teclado, QR DGI, Foto or Sugerencia for the "Sumar" chips). Tapping a single-line draft loads it back into the keypad to correct it (what was typed moves into the cart first); a purchase with several items can be split. "Vaciar" (with confirmation) empties the cart, and each row has its own ×.
- Voz (`components/registrar/VozSheet.vue`) and the camera (`CamaraSheet.vue`) open as full-screen `ion-modal`s over the keypad, not as routes. Ionic sends each tab button to the last URL visited in that tab, so with routes the + button would reopen Voz after saving from it.
- `?modo=voz|foto|qr` opens the matching modal (`escuchar=1` starts listening). Each URL is handled once (`handledPath`), so going back to the tab doesn't reopen it, and `nativeBridges` adds `&n=<timestamp>` to every external `rumbo://registrar` link so a second tap on a widget still works.
- Voz parses with `parseQuickEntries` (`domain/quickEntry.ts`), which first runs `spokenToDigits` (`domain/spokenNumbers.ts`) because dictation can return amounts in words ("mil doscientos", "dos lucas y media"); small numbers below 10 on their own ("dos empanadas") are left alone. `phraseDrafts` turns the result into drafts, shown under "Nuevos". `splitDuplicates` holds back anything already in the cart with the same name and amount ("Ómnibus $ 52: ¿duplicado?") until the user taps "Es otro viaje, agregarlo". Tapping a row changes its amount or category, or splits a purchase into one expense per item (`splitPurchase`).
- One phrase can hold several amounts ("en la feria gasté 168 de cebolla, 120 de tomate y 90 de papa"). `parseQuickEntries` splits it into `QuickItem`s:
  - It splits at commas and "y", decides once per phrase whether the amount comes before or after its words, and attaches amount-less chunks to the right item ("pan y leche 180").
  - Each keyword in `KEYWORDS` has a kind: `lugar` (feria, súper), `producto` (cebolla, yerba) or `gasto` (almuerzo, ómnibus).
  - `gasto` items (bus, lunch) always stand alone. `together` is true when at least two of the other items form one purchase, either because a single place was named or because they are all products. `phraseDrafts` makes that purchase one draft with one line per item, and makes each `apart` item its own draft. `gastos.addFromPhrase` (Siri and the watch) uses the same function.
  - Dictation quirks handled in the domain:
    - Uruguayan prices: "cuatro 80" → 480, and "4 480" → 480 (`joinPrices` in `spokenNumbers.ts`).
    - Spoken corrections: "o sea", "perdón", "corregí eso" make the next amount replace the previous item.
    - Periods act as separators.
    - Filler words are dropped ("ok", "bien", and "paste" for a misheard "gasté").
    - `MISHEARD` maps an item named only "Steam", "Sting" or "este" to STM.
  - A payment method said at the end, or said only once in a single purchase, applies to everything.
- Dictation goes through `services/speech.ts`. The mic button starts on a short tap and stops on the next one, or works as push-to-talk while held ("Mantené para sumar más": each dictation adds to "Nuevos"). Natively it uses the app-local `OfflineSpeech` plugin, and in the browser the Web Speech API. The plugin emits `partial` while the person speaks and `end` when the recognizer stops by itself (long silence or error).
- The camera keeps `@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning`'s `startScan()` running live. The plugin draws the preview behind the WebView, so `html.rb-scanning` (`theme/app.css`) makes everything transparent except `.camara`. The dark frame around the viewfinder is a large `box-shadow`. A DGI QR shows the "QR de la DGI detectado" card. The shutter takes a paper photo (`takePaperPhoto`: the document scanner on Android, the Camera plugin on iPhone), and the gallery button uses a file input (`pickImageFile`). After a ticket is added the camera stays open for the next one.
- Ticket por QR (`TicketQr.vue`): `parseCfeQr` (DGI URL `...consultaQR/cfe?RUT,TIPO,SERIE,NUMERO,TOTAL,FECHA,CODIGO`, validates the RUT check digit) → store name from `gastos.storeNameFor` (`KNOWN_STORES` or an earlier ticket with that RUT), category and payment → `demoReceiptReader.readLines(header)` → `qrDraft`. A ticket already saved or already in the cart is detected by `cfeKey` (rut-type-serie-number) and can't be added again. "Separar por productos" takes a photo and opens the paper screen with the QR as context. That makes one QR ticket with the photo's lines, and any amount above the QR total becomes a "Descuentos del ticket" discount.
- Ticket en papel (`TicketPapel.vue`): the paper-receipt flow described below. Rows are grouped by category (`productCategory` from the name, `paperGroups`), and `paperDrafts` adds either one expense or one per category ("Por categoría"). A doubtful amount must be confirmed ("Sí, es $ 210") or fixed before adding.

**Ticket sources.** `Ticket.source` takes one of five values (`SOURCE_LABEL` in `domain/categories.ts`):
- `'qr'`: verified through the DGI QR.
- `'papel'`: a photo of a receipt with no QR, such as a market stall's.
- `'voz'` and `'texto'`: a phrase, kept in `Ticket.phrase`.
- `'whatsapp'`: registered through the bot and downloaded on sync.

A ticket with `review` set (e.g. "No se leyó el monto") is not uploaded until the user types the amount in `GastoPage` and saves.

**Editing a movement** (`views/GastoPage.vue`, "Editar gasto"). Tapping a movement opens a form; nothing changes until "Guardar cambios", which calls `gastos.edit` (`TicketEdit`) and marks an uploaded ticket `pendiente` again.
- The form has Gasto/Ingreso, the amount with `$`/`USD` (single-line tickets only; with several items the amount is their sum and each item's category can be changed), Descripción (the store), Categoría, Medio de pago, Fecha, Nota (`Ticket.note`) and Comprobante (attach a photo to `photoUri`).
- Under the form there is a sync line ("Registrado por voz · se sube al volver la conexión") and "Eliminar gasto".
- An income is `Ticket.kind = 'ingreso'`. Lines stay positive. `isIncome`/`expensesOnly` (`domain/totals.ts`) keep incomes out of `budgetStatus`, `monthProjection`, `summarize`, bill matching, the widget's "today" and the "Sumar" chips. Lists show incomes as `+ $ X` in green, and the day totals in Movimientos add them.

**Sync** (`domain/sync.ts`, `stores/sync.ts`, `services/syncServer.ts`). Every ticket has `sync: { state: 'pendiente' | 'subido', remoteId? }`.
- `pendingToUpload` is every `pendiente` ticket without `review`. Editing an uploaded ticket marks it `pendiente` again.
- `syncNow()` first sends deletions, then pushes `toRemote(t)` (the local id goes as `clientId`), then pulls. `mergeRemote` matches by `clientId`, then `remoteId`, then `cfeKey`, so nothing is duplicated; unknown remote expenses are added as `'whatsapp'` tickets.
- A pending ticket only becomes `subido` when the server's copy `reflects` the local one (same store, amount, date, payment, category, kind and note). The server's `push` updates an existing `clientId` instead of ignoring it, so an edited ticket uploads again and doesn't stay pending forever.
- Deleting (`gastos.remove`, one id or many) records a `Deletion` (`clientId` plus `remoteId` if known) under the Preferences key `rumbo.borrados.v1`. `syncNow` sends the deletions with `server.remove` before anything else, and `mergeRemote` skips them, so a deleted movement never comes back from the server.
- It runs on start, whenever a new ticket becomes pending, and when the connection comes back (`services/network.ts`).
- The bot's server does not exist yet. `simulatedServer` keeps its data in Preferences, adds 700 ms of latency, and throws `OfflineError` when offline (real or simulated). A real server must implement the same `SyncServer` interface (`push`, `pull`, `remove`).

A paper ticket is unverified and has no discounts. It stores the photo as a downscaled JPEG data URL in `photoUri` (`services/photo.ts`) and may have a `writtenTotal`. `checkAgainstWrittenTotal` compares the lines against `writtenTotal` the same way `checkAgainstQr` compares them against the QR total.

Paper tickets have no RUT or number, so `cfeKey` dedupe doesn't apply. `findSimilarTicket` (same day, same amount) only asks before adding and never blocks.

A reader can flag an amount it isn't sure about with `ReadItem.doubtful`. Apple Intelligence fills a `doubtful` field in the `@Generable` schema, and Gemini Nano writes `?` after the amount ("210?"), which `parsePaperFormat` reads.

The `PaperReader` interface (`services/receiptReader.ts`) is the seam for automatic reading, and `choosePaperReader()` picks the implementation:
- `onDevicePaperReader` (`kind: 'ia'`) on iOS 27 devices whose Apple Intelligence model reports the `.vision` capability.
- `ocrPaperReader` (`kind: 'ocr'`) on Android and on other iPhones. It runs ML Kit text recognition (no AI) and builds lines with `parseOcrLines` (`domain/ocr.ts`), which groups OCR fragments by height so a name and the amount to its right become one item. Tested on real handwriting on a Redmi Note 11, it read 2 fragments out of a whole page, so it is only useful for printed receipts. `domain/ocr.ts` tests include that real capture.
- `manualPaperReader` (`kind: 'manual'`, reads nothing) in the browser.

On Android the photo comes from ML Kit's document scanner (`services/paperCapture.ts`), which crops and straightens the paper and hands the reader a full-resolution file.

On Android, `nanoPaperReader` (`kind: 'ia'`) uses Gemini Nano via `@capacitor-mlkit/genai-prompt` when `checkFeatureStatus()` is `AVAILABLE`.
- It needs AICore (Pixel 9 or newer, Galaxy S24/S25…). On `DOWNLOADABLE` the app requests the download and falls back to OCR meanwhile.
- Nano returns free text, so the prompt asks for the compact line format in `domain/promptFormat.ts` (`PAPER_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS` and `parsePaperFormat` live together).
- It runs with `temperature: 0`, `topK: 1` and a fixed seed, so the same photo gives the same reading.
- It requires `minSdkVersion = 26` (`android/variables.gradle`).
- The test Redmi Note 11 returns `UNAVAILABLE`, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra (Android 16, serial in `$ANDROID_SERIAL`) rejects it with AICore error 606 "Feature 636 is not available" (no Prompt API on that model). This path is untested on a real model. The S24 does have on-device speech (`es-US`).

To query plugins on the phone without touching it, attach to the WebView DevTools socket (debug builds only):
- `adb -s <serial> forward tcp:9333 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_$(adb -s <serial> shell pidof uy.rumbo.app)`.
- Then send `Runtime.evaluate` over the WebSocket listed at `http://localhost:9333/json`, e.g. `Capacitor.Plugins.GenAiPrompt.checkFeatureStatus()`.

Whatever is read only pre-fills the form. `normalizePaperReading` cleans the model output first, and the user always reviews before saving.

**Per-vendor learning** (`domain/vendors.ts`) replaces any hardcoded glossary of market abbreviations. Don't add vendor knowledge to the model instructions by hand.
- The user picks the vendor ("¿De qué puesto es?") in the paper screen's summary card, after the photo. If that vendor has rules and nothing was edited yet, an `ia` reader reads the photo again with them; other readers just re-apply `applyVendorRules`. The model's own store name is ignored, because it hallucinates names and a fake vendor would collect bad rules.
- When the ticket is added to the cart, `learnFromTicket` compares what the model read (each line has `written`, the literal text, plus `name`) with what the user saved. It pairs lines by amount, then by product name, and stores `abbreviations` (written → product) and `products` (last price) for that vendor. Lines it can't pair confidently teach nothing.
- On the next ticket from that vendor, `vendorRulesContext` is passed to the model as extra instructions, and `applyVendorRules` deterministically replaces names whose literal text matches a learned abbreviation.
- The rules are stored on-device only, under the Preferences key `rumbo.puestos.v1`, keyed by `vendorKey(name)`.

**App-local native plugin.** `PaperVision` (`ios/App/App/PaperVisionPlugin.swift`) wraps the Foundation Models framework. It sends `Attachment(cgImage)` plus a `@Generable` `PaperReceipt` schema.
- It is registered in `MainViewController.swift` (`capacitorDidLoad`). The Capacitor 8 template builds the root view controller in code in `SceneDelegate.swift`, which ignores `Main.storyboard`, so `SceneDelegate` must instantiate `MainViewController()`.
- On launch the plugin prints `PaperVision: modelo <status>` to the Xcode/devicectl console, which shows whether the device can read paper receipts.
- New Swift files must be added to the `App` target in `project.pbxproj`. The project has no synchronized folders. Use the `xcodeproj` gem bundled with CocoaPods rather than editing by hand.
- The Mac here runs macOS 26, which lacks the image API, so test this on the iPhone.

**App-local speech plugin.** `OfflineSpeech` exists on both platforms with the same API (`availability`, `start({hints})`, `stop`):
- iOS (`ios/App/App/OfflineSpeechPlugin.swift`, registered next to `PaperVision`) has two engines, and both run on-device. It tries the locales `es-UY`, `es-AR`, `es-419`, `es-US`… in that order. It needs `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`.
  - On iOS 26+ it uses `SpeechAnalyzer` + `SpeechTranscriber` (`.progressiveTranscription`), wrapped in `AnalyzerSession`. On launch, `prepareAnalyzer()` checks `AssetInventory` and downloads the Spanish model if needed; this needs a connection once. It logs `OfflineSpeech: SpeechAnalyzer es_US · <status>`. Microphone buffers are converted with `AVAudioConverter` to `bestAvailableAudioFormat`. Final results are appended and the volatile one is shown on top. The test iPhone uses `es_US`.
  - Otherwise it falls back to `SFSpeechRecognizer` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition`. That recognizer **restarts its transcription after every pause**, so `receive()` joins the pieces: a piece is closed when `speechRecognitionMetadata` arrives, or when `isNewSegment` detects a restart. It logs `OfflineSpeech: <locale> · sin conexión: <bool>`.
  - It logs `OfflineSpeech: entendido "<text>"` per dictation. `VozSheet` logs `Dictado {phrase, parsed}`, and those make good test cases.
- Android (`android/app/src/main/java/uy/rumbo/app/OfflineSpeechPlugin.java`, registered in `MainActivity.onCreate` before `super`):
  - On Android 13+ it asks the on-device recognizer which Spanish is installed (`checkRecognitionSupport`) and requests the download when that Spanish is only supported. Otherwise it uses Google's recognizer with `EXTRA_PREFER_OFFLINE`, which works offline only if the offline Spanish pack is downloaded.
  - The manifest needs `RECORD_AUDIO` and a `<queries>` entry for `android.speech.RecognitionService`, or `isRecognitionAvailable` returns false on Android 11+.
  - The recognizer **ends its session after each pause** (≈1 s). On the Galaxy S24 it ignores `EXTRA_SEGMENTED_SESSION`. `continueOrFinish` therefore restarts listening with the same intent until the user taps stop (or `MAX_DICTATION_MS`), and `receive()` joins the pieces.
  - `start` resolves on `onReadyForSpeech`, because the mic takes about 1 s to open. Until then the UI shows "Preparando el micrófono…".
  - Logcat tag `OfflineSpeech` logs every partial (`parcial:`), `final:` and `entendido "…"`.
- Each dictation has a `session` number so late callbacks from a cancelled one can't end the current one.

**Widgets, controls, Siri and reminders (iOS).** These features share data through the App Group `group.uy.rumbo.app`. Both targets carry entitlements: `App/App.entitlements` and `RumboWidgets/RumboWidgets.entitlements`. Free Personal Team signing accepts the App Group.
- `composables/nativeBridges.ts` (started from `App.vue`) rebuilds `widgetSnapshot()` (`domain/widgets.ts`) whenever tickets, budget or bills change. The snapshot holds already-formatted text, and the `RumboWidgets` plugin (`App/RumboWidgetsPlugin.swift`) writes it to the App Group and reloads timelines and controls.
- The `RumboWidgets` extension target (iOS 18+, bundle `uy.rumbo.app.widgets`) follows the proposal's Widgets board:
  - `DisponibleWidget`:
    - Small: the amount and "72% de octubre usado".
    - Medium: adds "+ Gasto" and the last three expenses with "N sin sincronizar".
    - Lock screen: a ring of the percent used, plus "$ X disponible / Tarjeta vence el viernes".
  - `RegistrarWidget`: a small 2×2 Voz/Texto/Foto/QR grid, and a mic button on the lock screen.
  - `RegistrarGastoControl`: the "Registrar gasto" control for Control Center and the Action button.
  - The widgets only read `RumboSnapshot` and never recompute; the Swift struct must mirror `WidgetSnapshot` (`usedText` and `nextBill.shortText` come precomputed).
- `App/Shared/` (`RumboShared.swift`, `RumboOpenIntents.swift`) belongs to **both** targets. The open intents return `OpenURLIntent(rumbo://…)`.
- App Intents (`App/RumboAppIntents.swift`, app target only) provide the Siri phrases:
  - "Anotar un gasto en Rumbo" appends the phrase to an App Group inbox without opening the app. `nativeBridges` imports it on launch or resume through `gastos.addFromPhrase`.
  - "Cuánto me queda en Rumbo" and "Qué vence en Rumbo" answer from the snapshot.
  - The project's development region is `es`, so the Siri phrases match in Spanish.
- Deep links use `rumbo://` (`CFBundleURLTypes`) and `deepLinkRoute()` (`domain/deepLinks.ts`). `rumbo://registrar?modo=voz&escuchar=1` opens the Voz screen already listening (`RegistrarPage` → `VozSheet autoListen`).
- Bill reminders use `@capacitor/local-notifications`. `billReminderPlan()` (`domain/bills.ts`) schedules 10:00 two days before each unpaid, non-autopay bill this month and next, but only when `finanzas.remindersOn` is set by the switch in Facturas. Tapping a reminder opens `rumbo://facturas`.
- New widget files must be added to the `RumboWidgets` target with the xcodeproj gem, the same way as other new Swift files. `ionic cap sync` doesn't touch the extension, because the Podfile only covers `App`.

**Apple Watch.** It is built from two watchOS targets embedded in the iOS app. The `Embed Watch Content` build phase copies the watch app to `$(CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH)/Watch`.
- `RumboWatch` (bundle `uy.rumbo.app.watchkitapp`, watchOS 10+, single-target SwiftUI app) follows the proposal artifact's Watch board, "only the essentials". The flow is Inicio → system dictation → Confirmar → Listo.
  - Inicio shows the available amount, a thin bar and "Dictar gasto". When transfers are queued it adds "Sin conexión · N en cola".
  - Dictation takes one tap (`DictadoView` + `Recorder.swift`). watchOS has no speech API for apps, and its system dictation always opens the keyboard first, so the app records instead.
    - `Recorder` records 16 kHz AAC with live meter bars and stops after 1.6 s of silence.
    - The file goes to the iPhone with `transferFile`. `WatchBridge` transcribes it on-device (`FileTranscriber`: SpeechAnalyzer, falling back to SFSpeechRecognizer) and returns `{id, transcript}` by `sendMessage`, or by `transferUserInfo` as a fallback.
    - If the iPhone is unreachable, or doesn't answer within 12 s, the recording is marked `autosave`. The iPhone then saves the transcript directly to the inbox, with no confirmation.
    - `WatchBridge.activate()` runs in `AppDelegate`, because the watch can wake the app in the background.
    - Typing through `TextFieldLink` only appears when the microphone fails.
  - Confirmar shows the amount, category and payment method from `QuickParse.swift`, a display-only Swift port of the phrase parser. It has "Guardar" and "Cambiar categoría". A changed category travels as `category` in the userInfo, and `gastos.addFromPhrase` applies it.
  - The phrase goes to the iPhone with `transferUserInfo`, which queues while the phone is away. On the iPhone, `App/WatchBridge.swift` appends it to the same App Group inbox as Siri. The plugin then fires an `inbox` event so the app imports it at once (`onInboxChanged` in `nativeBridges`).
- The iPhone sends the snapshot with `updateApplicationContext` each time `RumboWidgets.update` runs. The watch app saves it in its own App Group, which is per device, for the complications.
- `RumboWatchWidgets` (bundle `uy.rumbo.app.watchkitapp.widgets`) is the complications extension. As in the design, it has a ring of the used share with the available amount inside ("12,4k"), plus a "+" complication that opens the app. Both watch targets compile `App/Shared/RumboShared.swift`.
- Installing on the watch: the test watch is an Apple Watch Series 10 on watchOS 27, UDID in `$WATCH_UDID`.
  - Xcode 27 has no "Devices and Simulators" window. Devices live in the separate **Device Hub** app.
  - To connect the watch: in Device Hub choose File → Pair Nearby Device…, then on the watch turn on Developer Mode (Settings → Privacy & Security) and pair it. The Developer Mode option only showed up on the watch after Device Hub had been waiting to pair.
  - Then build the shared `RumboWatch` scheme with the watch as destination, using `-allowProvisioningUpdates -allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration`. That registers the watch's UDID in the free profiles.
  - Install with `xcrun devicectl device install app --device <watch> …/Debug-watchos/RumboWatch.app`.
  - Without that registration, the iPhone's Watch app offers "Instalar", but the install fails.
  - `xcrun devicectl device capture screenshot --device <watch> --destination x.png` takes a screenshot of the watch.
- To check that the watch Swift compiles without a watch, run `xcodebuild -project App.xcodeproj -target RumboWatch -sdk watchos CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build`.

**Android widgets and shortcuts** (`android/app/src/main/java/uy/rumbo/app/`):
- The `RumboWidgets` plugin saves the same snapshot JSON in SharedPreferences (`RumboWidgetData`) and redraws the RemoteViews widgets:
  - `DisponibleWidget` uses a small layout, or a medium one from about 250 dp wide (it has quick links), picked by size on Android 12+.
  - `RegistrarWidget` is the 2×2 Voz/Texto/Foto/QR grid, the same as the iPhone's. It only opens `rumbo://registrar?modo=…` links and doesn't read the snapshot.
  - `VencimientoWidget` shows the next bill due.
- `DictarTileService` is a quick-settings tile that opens `rumbo://registrar?modo=voz&escuchar=1`.
- Static launcher shortcuts live in `res/xml/shortcuts.xml`.
- `MainActivity` has an intent filter for the `rumbo` scheme. Capacitor's App plugin turns those intents into `appUrlOpen`.

**Seams for real implementations.** The `ReceiptReader` interface in `services/receiptReader.ts` is where a vision-model backend (`POST /receipts/read`) will plug in. Today it returns fixed lines for the demo QR and a single "total" line for any real QR. `KNOWN_STORES` (RUT → name and category) in `data/seed.ts` is a demo stand-in for a server table. `simulatedServer` is the seam for the bot's real server. The README's "Qué es real y qué es demo" table tracks what is real and what is still demo.

**Bills** (`domain/bills.ts`, `views/FacturasPage.vue`, `views/FacturaPage.vue`). Facturas is reached from Inicio's bill card, which is always there when bills exist ("Próximo vencimiento", "Vencida sin pagar" or "Todo pagado este mes"). It also opens from Metas → Tarjeta de crédito → Ver facturas, and from reminder notifications.
- The + creates a bill (`/tabs/inicio/facturas/nueva`) and tapping a bill edits or deletes it (`/tabs/inicio/facturas/:id`).
- The circle marks it paid by adding the payment as an expense (`billPaymentTicket`: the bill's name, `billCategory`, the last payment method used for it, `billId`). Unmarking deletes that expense.
- A bill is paid by (in order) its own `billId` expense, a manual `paid[month]` record (older data), or a registered expense that `findBillPayment` recognizes. That last kind can only be unmarked by changing the expense.
- A bill with `variable` ("El monto cambia cada mes", like UTE or gastos comunes) shows its `amount` as an estimate (`≈ $ 2.150`, `BillStatus.estimated`) until that month's real amount is known. That amount comes from `Bill.amounts[month]` (typed in the form, or asked when marking it paid) or from the matched payment ticket. The last amount paid becomes the next estimate.
- `findBillPayment` accepts ±5 % for fixed bills and ±35 % for variable ones without a month amount. `BillStatus.amount` (not `bill.amount`) is what Facturas' totals, reminders and the widget use.

**Goal forms.** The + in Metas opens "Nueva meta de ahorro" (`views/NuevaMetaPage.vue`, `/tabs/metas/nueva`), and the + in Inversión opens "Meta de inversión" (`views/NuevaInversionPage.vue`, `/tabs/metas/inversion/nueva`).
- Savings goal: preset chips, target, amount already saved (added as the first movement), "Para cuándo" (`SavingsGoal.deadline`, a month key) and where the money is kept. "Para llegar a tiempo" comes from `monthlyToReach` and becomes the goal's `monthly`.
- "Recordarme el aporte" (`SavingsGoal.remind`) schedules a notification on the 1st of each month at 10:00 (`goalReminderPlan` → `scheduleGoalReminders`, kind `meta`, which opens `rumbo://metas`). Bill reminders use kind `factura`, and each kind only replaces its own notifications.
- Investment goal: target and invested amount in USD, a term in years, and sliders for the monthly contribution and the assumed yearly return. The result uses `futureValue`, and `monthlyNeeded` gives the contribution that reaches the target. Creating it also points Inversión's simulation at the new goal.

**Routing** (`router/index.ts`). Everything lives under `/tabs/` in `TabsPage.vue`, whose tabs are `inicio`, `presupuesto`, `registrar` (the round + button), `metas` and `movimientos`. Detail pages are nested under their tab so the tab bar stays visible: `inicio/facturas`, `inicio/gasto/:id`, `movimientos/gasto/:id` (the same `GastoPage`), `movimientos/sync` (Sincronización, opened from the sync icon in Movimientos and the status pill in Inicio), `metas/ahorro/:id` and `metas/inversion`. The old `sync`, `sync/gasto/:id` and `inicio/movimientos` routes redirect. Registrar and the forms (editing a movement, new goals) are full-screen: `TabsPage` hides the tab bar on those routes (`FULL_SCREEN`), and Cancelar (which asks before discarding the cart) returns to the tab recorded in `composables/lastTab.ts`. Navigate with `useIonRouter()` from `@ionic/vue` so Ionic's page transitions and stack work.

Movimientos has search, the "Sin subir" and "Por revisar" chips, and a category chip that comes from Presupuesto's "Ver gastos" (`?categoria=`). The filters and the search cover every month.
- "Seleccionar" turns on multi-select: rows show a check circle (`GastoRow` `selecting`/`selected`), each day has "Todo el día", and the top bar offers "Todos".
- A red "Eliminar N movimientos" button sticks to the bottom and deletes the selection after a confirmation.
- Selection only covers what the current filters show.

**Theming.** Ionic is forced to `mode: 'ios'` on every platform, and the views mostly use plain HTML styled like iOS grouped lists rather than Ionic list components. The palette is CSS variables `--rb-*` in `theme/variables.css`, following the proposal's "Sistema de diseño" board:
- Colors: accent green `#16815F`, secondary text `#55555A`, gray icons `#8E8E93`, neutral borders `#C7C7CC`, blue `#2F5BEA`, and amber attention backgrounds and text (`--rb-attention*`, `#FFF4E5` / `#8A4B08`).
- Rules: one alert per screen (`rb-alert`), shown only for something that needs action. Sync states are gray icons with no text (`components/SyncIcon.vue`); amber is only for "revisar".
- Shared classes are in `theme/app.css`: `rb-group`, `rb-row` (56 px), `rb-card`, `rb-section`, `rb-btn` with `primary` / `secondary` / `fix` / `neutral` / `soft` (52 px), `rb-chip` (40 px), `rb-pill`, `rb-alert`, `rb-search`, …. Category colors and subcategories live in `domain/categories.ts`. The app is light mode only. The Geist font is bundled via `@fontsource/geist` so the app works offline. Alerts and action sheets use `alertController`/`actionSheetController`.

## Native (Capacitor)

`appId` is `uy.rumbo.app` (`appName` Rumbo; the Android package and `MainActivity` live in `uy/rumbo/app`) and `webDir` is `dist`. The launcher icons and splash screens were drawn by a CoreGraphics script, not `@capacitor/assets`. QR scanning uses `@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning`, which installs the Google scanner module on Android on demand.

**Android** (`android/`):
- `ANDROID_HOME` is not set in this shell. Export `ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk`, then run `ionic cap sync android`, `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`, and `adb -s <serial> install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
- With an emulator also attached, `adb` needs `-s <serial>`.
- The test phone is a Xiaomi. MIUI rejects USB installs (`INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`) unless "Instalar vía USB" is enabled in developer options, and every install must be confirmed on the phone's screen within a few seconds.
- The debug APK is ~77 MB, mostly because `@capacitor-mlkit/text-recognition` bundles OCR models for every script (Latin, Chinese, Devanagari, Japanese, Korean).
- JS `console.*` reaches logcat (`Capacitor/Console`) only in debug builds. `ocrPaperReader` logs `PaperOCR {lines, reading}` there, which can be turned into `domain/ocr.ts` test cases.

**iOS** (`ios/`) has some non-obvious constraints:
- It uses **CocoaPods, not SPM**. The ML Kit plugin has no `Package.swift`, so Capacitor 8's default SPM template silently drops the scanner. The platform was created with `npx cap add ios --packagemanager CocoaPods`, because `ionic cap add` doesn't forward that flag.
- `pod install` (also run by `ionic cap sync ios`) crashes with "Unicode Normalization not appropriate for ASCII-8BIT" unless the shell has a UTF-8 locale: prefix with `LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`.
- The deployment target is **15.5**, set in both the `Podfile` and `project.pbxproj`, because GoogleMLKit 8 requires it.
- **`ios/` can't build for the iOS Simulator.** ML Kit ships no arm64-simulator slice (the pods set `EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = arm64`), and Xcode 27 offers no x86_64 simulators. To preview natively, build a throwaway copy of `ios/` outside the repo:
  - Point the Podfile paths at the absolute `node_modules`, delete every `CapacitorMlkit*` pod (barcode scanning, text recognition, document scanner), and remove their plugin classes from `App/capacitor.config.json` → `packageClassList`.
  - Then run `pod install` and build. The QR scanner and the OCR won't work in that build; the rest of the UI will.
- Safe areas only exist natively (they are 0 in the browser). `ion-tab-bar` already adds `--ion-safe-area-bottom` as padding with `box-sizing: content-box`, so don't add it again to its height.
- Signing uses automatic style with the developer's Personal Team (`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = UUPAXS7TLU`). Free-provisioned installs expire after 7 days: the app, its widgets and the watch app then refuse to open ("invalid code signature… not explicitly trusted").
  - To renew, rebuild with `-allowProvisioningUpdates` (this creates new profiles) and install over the existing app; the data is kept. Reinstall the watch app separately too.
  - If it still won't open, the iPhone has to verify the developer again under Ajustes → General → VPN y gestión de dispositivos, with an internet connection.
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` is set in `ios/App/App/Info.plist`.
